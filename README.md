**Question:**<br>
Is there a correlation between high ratings and show popularity?

The dataset shows some insights on a good amount of shows on hulu that i can analyze. Besides the fact that movies/shows interest me, it will also be interesting to see the trends in genres, episode counts, and other stuff.

**What I hope to learn**<br>
I hope to learn more about the trends in streaming content.

**My goal**<br>
My goal is to explore data analysis with the python tools like matplotlib and seaborn.
